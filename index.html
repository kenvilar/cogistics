                    Freight billing errors, hidden accessorials, and poor
                    visibility. These small issues add up to real losses. For
                    most companies, it's not a matter of if there is waste in
                    freight spend, it's how much. Without 100% audit coverage,
                    you're leaving 5 to 15% of your freight budget on the table.
                    COGISTICS' audit engine puts you back in control of your
                    transportation budget by catching what others miss and
                    providing the analytics to prevent issues before they
                    happen.
